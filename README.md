# 🧠 DS-ML-Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments and practical notebooks from my **Data Science and Machine Learning** course at **AI Quest Intelligence**. These assignments are completed using **Python** and are designed to strengthen my understanding of essential DS/ML concepts through hands-on practice.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

Each file in this repository is a self-contained assignment in `.ipynb` format, including:

- ✅ Clear code with inline explanations  
- 🧪 Conceptual exercises and practical use cases  
- 📊 Data analysis and manipulation examples  
- 📈 Visualizations and model evaluations  
- 🔁 Iterative learning as I progress through the course

## 📁 File Structure

```bash
DS-ML-Assignments/
├── assignment_01.ipynb: Basic Python Problems
├── assignment_02.ipynb: 118 Problems on Python
├── assignment_03.ipynb: Linear Regression
├── assignment_04 ([Kaggle Assignment] (https://tinyurl.com/asgmt4)): Regression on High-Dimensional Space (Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression)
├── assignment_05.ipynb: Comparison between KNN Regressor and Linear Regression, and KNN Classifier and  Logistic Regression
